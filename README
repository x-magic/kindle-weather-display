My version changes python/XML to PHP/json and also uses Weather Underground API so usable around the world. 

Remember to replace API Key and set correct paths before start using!

Updates:
- Added a battery drained image. It will show up when battery capacity is less than 10% and is not charging. 
- Added a function that allow you to disable weather stand since once it's on you can't read Kindle anymore unless reboot.
